asteroid base
You're outta luck! Teleporting into the asteroid base, you could barely wait to get your hands on all the loot. Slight problem though, you seem to be locked in a room with nowhere to go. Can you find your way out or will you rot in space, an anonymous bounty hunter lost for all of time?
